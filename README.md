Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects: "Organic and Non-Organic Waste Classification" and "Rock Paper Scissors Classification". These projects aim to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
Organic and Non-Organic Waste Classification
Introduction

The "Organic and Non-Organic Waste Classification" project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to accurately classify waste into organic and non-organic categories. The proper classification of waste plays a crucial role in efficient recycling and waste management processes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to automate waste classification and contribute to environmental sustainability.
Features

    Dataset Collection: Scripts and utilities are provided for collecting and curating a diverse dataset of waste samples, including images, textual descriptions, and other relevant attributes.
    Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques are implemented to clean and transform the collected data, ensuring it is suitable for training the classification models.
    Feature Extraction: Methods for extracting meaningful features from raw data are included to enable the models to learn discriminative patterns.
    Model Training and Evaluation: Various machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, decision trees, or ensemble methods, are implemented to train classification models. Evaluation metrics are computed to assess the models' performance.
    Model Deployment: Functionality is provided to deploy the trained models into production environments, allowing real-time or batch inference for waste classification.
    Interactive Interface: A user-friendly interface is included to interact with the trained models, enabling users to upload waste samples and receive classification predictions.

Rock Paper Scissors Classification
Introduction

The "Rock Paper Scissors Classification" project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify images of hand gestures representing rock, paper, or scissors. This project aims to showcase the application of machine learning in image classification tasks and provide a fun and interactive way to play the game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
Features

    Dataset Collection: A dataset of hand gesture images representing rock, paper, and scissors is provided.
    Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques are applied to the images to enhance their quality and prepare them for model training.
    Model Training and Evaluation: Machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to train the classification model. Evaluation metrics are computed to assess the model's performance.
    Real-time Classification: The trained model is deployed to perform real-time classification of hand gestures, allowing users to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
    Interactive Gameplay: An interactive interface is provided to facilitate gameplay, where users can make hand gestures and receive the computer's response.
